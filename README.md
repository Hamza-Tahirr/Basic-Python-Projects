## For Calculator app 
The calculator() function contains a while loop that continues to prompt the user for input until the user types 'quit' at any prompt. The print() function displays a message telling the user how to exit the program.
The next three lines prompt the user to enter the first number, second number, and operator for the arithmetic operation. The input() function is used to get input from the user, and the input is stored in the num1, num2, and operator variables, respectively. If the user types 'quit' at any of these prompts, the break statement is used to exit the while loop and end the program.
The try block attempts to convert the user input for num1 and num2 into floating-point numbers using the float() function. If the user enters a non-numeric value (e.g. a string), the float() function will raise a ValueError exception. The except block catches this exception and displays an error message using the print() function. The continue statement is used to skip the remaining code in the while loop and start the loop over again.
Once the user input has been successfully converted to numeric values, the program checks the operator variable to determine which arithmetic operation to perform. If the operator is '+', '-', '*', or '/', the corresponding operation is performed and the result is stored in the result variable. If the operator is not one of these four options, the program displays an error message and starts the while loop over again.
If the user selects the division operator ('/'), the program also checks if the second number is zero. Dividing by zero is not allowed in arithmetic, so the program displays an error message and starts the while loop over again.
Finally, the program displays the arithmetic operation and the result using the print() function, and adds a newline character at the end to make the output easier to read.

## For TODO App
The code starts by defining an empty list called tasks
This list will store all the tasks that the user wants to add, edit, or delete.

The add_task() function takes one argument, task, which represents the task that the user wants to add. This function appends the task to the tasks list and prints a message confirming that the task was added.
The edit_task() function takes two arguments: task_number, which is the index of the task to be edited (minus one, because the user will input a number starting from 1), and new_task, which is the new task to replace the old one. This function updates the specified task in the tasks list with the new task and prints a message confirming that the task was edited
The delete_task() function takes one argument, task_number, which is the index of the task to be deleted (minus one, because the user will input a number starting from 1). This function deletes the specified task from the tasks list and prints a message confirming that the task was deleted
The show_tasks() function doesn't take any arguments. This function prints the current list of tasks, or a message saying that the list is empty if there are no tasks
The while loop that follows is the main part of the program. It displays a menu of options for the user to choose from and prompts the user for input using the input() function
The user's choice is then checked using a series of if statements
If the user selects "1", the program prompts the user for a task to add and calls the add_task() function to add it to the list. If the user selects "2", the program prompts the user for the number of the task to edit, and the new task to replace it with, and calls the edit_task() function
